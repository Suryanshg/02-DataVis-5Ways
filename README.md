Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways  
===

In this project, I used the following tools to visualize a scatterplot of Weight vs MPG (Miles-per-gallon) of "cars-sample.csv" data:
1. JavaScript + d3.js
2. R + ggplot2
3. Python + Matplotlib
4. MS Excel
5. Tableau

# JavaScript + d3

# R + ggplot2 + R Markdown

R is a language primarily focused on statistical computing.
ggplot2 is a popular library for charting in R.
R Markdown is a document format that compiles to HTML or PDF and allows you to include the output of R code directly in the document.

To visualized the cars dataset, I made use of ggplot2's `geom_point()` layer, with aesthetics functions for the color and size.

While it takes time to find the correct documentation, these functions made the effort creating this chart minimal.
